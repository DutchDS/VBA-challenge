In this folder you'll find the script used to generate screenshots VBAStock 2014, VBAStock 2015 and VBAStock 2016.
The VBS script knows 2 macros that can be run. 

When running Run_VBAStock all worksheets will be processed.
When running Fill_Summary_Tables only the currently active sheet will be processed.

Within the Fill_Summary_Tables the Create_Summary_Table_Headers() will run to create and format the tables to be filled.
